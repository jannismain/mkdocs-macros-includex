    r"""Include parts of a file.

    Note:
        Whitespace (spaces, empty lines) will be stripped from the end of file.
        This prevents all includes of full files to end in a newline.

    Args:
        filepath: file to include
        start: line number to begin include (is overwritten, if start_match matches a line).
        end: line number to end include (is overwritten, if end_match matches a line).

            Use negative numbers to index from end of file (e.g. -3 to skip last 3 lines of file).
            Must be greater than start, otherwise no content will be returned.

        lines: number of lines to return (takes precedence over end and end_match)
        dedent (bool): dedent by indentation of first line to be returned
        dedent (int): dedent by that many characters
        indent: add this many *indent_char*s to beginning of each line
        indent_char: single character to use for indentation (default: " " â†’ *space*)
        indent_first: whether to also indent the first line

            `indent` might be used to make the content match the indentation of the document
            where the content is included. As the `include_partial` statement will already be
            indented, the first line doesn't need to be indented in most cases where an indent
            would be used.

        start_match: find start by providing text that shall match the first line
        end_match: find end by providing text that shall match the last line.

            !!! warning
                Cannot be used together with *lines*

        start_offset: number of lines to offset line found by *start_match*
            provide positive integer to exclude that many lines after matched line
            provide negative integer to include additional lines before matched line
        end_offset: number of lines to offset line found by *end_match*

            - provide positive integer to include additional lines after matched line
            - provide negative integer to exclude lines before matched line

        include_last: also include the last line (same as `end_offset=1`)
        silence_errors: if true, do not return exception messages
        raw: will wrap file content in {% raw %} block.

            this prevents further interpretation of the file content by jinja.

        escape (Tuple[str]): characters in list will be escaped using `\`
        replace (Tuple[Tuple(str, str)]): replace arbitrary substrings
        add_heading_levels: If > 0, append as many "#" to any line starting with "#"

            this is meant to be used with Markdown files, that need to fit into an existing header structure

        lang: wrap included file in markdown code fences with this language

            this was added to support escaping an included file (using `raw`) but not have
            the raw-tags part of the code block.

        escape_notice: include note about escaped characters at the end
        replace_notice: include note about replaced strings at the end

    Returns:
        content of file at *filepath*, restricted by remaining arguments

    !!! seealso "Examples"
        Have a look at [test_macros][] for some examples on how to use [macros.include_partial][]
