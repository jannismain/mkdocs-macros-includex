    Note:
        Whitespace (spaces, empty lines) will be stripped from the end of file.
        This prevents all includes of full files to end in a newline.

    Args:
        filepath: file to include
        start: line number to begin include (is overwritten, if start_match matches a line).
        end: line number to end include (is overwritten, if end_match matches a line).

            Use negative numbers to index from end of file (e.g. -3 to skip last 3 lines of file).
            Must be greater than start, otherwise no content will be returned.

        lines: number of lines to return (takes precedence over end and end_match)
        dedent (bool): dedent by indentation of first line to be returned
        dedent (int): dedent by that many characters
        indent: add this many *indent_char*s to beginning of each line
        indent_char: single character to use for indentation (default: " " â†’ *space*)
        start_match: find start by providing text that shall match the first line
        end_match: find end by providing text that shall match the last line.

            !!! warning
                Cannot be used together with *lines*

        start_offset: number of lines to offset line found by *start_match*
            provide positive integer to exclude that many lines after matched line
            provide negative integer to include additional lines before matched line
        end_offset: number of lines to offset line found by *end_match*

            - provide positive integer to include additional lines after matched line
            - provide negative integer to exclude lines before matched line

            e.g. end_offset=1 will include the matched line in the output (default)

        silence_errors: if true, do not return exception messages

    Returns:
        content of file at *filepath*, restricted by remaining arguments
